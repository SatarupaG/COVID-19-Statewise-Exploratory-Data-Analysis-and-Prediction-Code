# COVID-19 Statewise Exploratory Data Analysis & Prediction
This repository hosts the python codes (jupyter notebooks) for the latest Covid-19 State wise EDA project

## Tools/Packages/Libraries
1. Python (Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) 
2. Jupyter Notebook


##  Problem Statement
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19 - World Health Organization.

##  Objective
Develop EDA tools to analyze and investigate Indiaâ€™s State-wise COVID-19 datasets to summarize the main characteristics and their relationships. 

## Learning Outcomes 
1. Implemented data visualization techniques such as Histogram, Heat map, etc. 
2. Implemented data preprocessing techniques for creating Model Ready Data (MRD) useful in developing effective machine learning (ML) models.
